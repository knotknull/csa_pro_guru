## Data Stores
###################################################################################################


## Concepts
#############


## Persistent Datastore
Data is durable after reboots, restarts, powercycles
	- Glacier
	- RDS

## Transient Datastore
Data is temporarily stored and passed along to another process / persistent store
	- SQS
	- SNS

## Ephemeral Datastore
Data is lost when stopped
	- EC2
	- Memcached

## IOPS vs Throughput

Input/Output Operations per Second (IOPS)
  Measure how fast we can read and write to a device

Throughput
  How much data can be moved at a time



## Consistency Models: ACID & BASE
Atomic		All or nothing
Consistent	Must be valid
Isolated	Transactions can't interfere
Durable		Completed transaction stays around

Basic Availability	values availability even if state
Soft-state		might not be instantly consistent across stores
Eventually Consistent	will achieve consistency at some point


## S3
#############

S3 is an Object Store
 - used in other AWS services

  ** Maximum object size is 5TB
  ** Largest object in a single PUT is 5GB
  NOTE: Use multi-part uploads if larger than 100MB

s3://bucket/finance/april/invoice_1234.pdf = a Key, NOT A FILEPATH

## S3 Consistency

Documentation																Real world
--------------------------- 								--------------------------------
S3 provides read-after-write 								Write it and read it immediately
consistency for PUTS of new objects

HEAD or GET requests of the key before      Respond with "never seen it" until
an object exists will result in eventual    I completely write new object and
consistency																	fully replicate it.

S3 offers eventual consistency for 					Update or delete completely locally,
overwrite PUTS and DELETES									then replicate elsewhere. Until then
																						serve up the current file

Updates to a single key are atomic					Only one person can update this object,
 																						if two requests, process in order of
																						timestamp.  Updates seen as soon as
																						replication is done elsewhere.



## S3 Security

	- Resource-based (Object ACL, Bucket policy)
	- User-based  (IAM Policies)
	- Optional Multi-factor Authentication before delete

	----------------------------
  |  Is your user account    |---------  NO
  |  allowed to access me?   |
	----------------------------
            |
            | yes
	----------------------------
  |  Does the bucket policy  |---------  NO
  |  allow access to you     |
	----------------------------
            |
            | yes
	----------------------------
  |  Does the object ACL      |---------  NO
  |  allow you access to it   |
	----------------------------
            |
            | yes
		-------------------
    |    Access it    |
		-------------------


## S3 Versioning
	- New version with each write
	- Enables "roll-back" and "un-delete" capabilities
	- Old versions count as billable size until they are permanently deleted
	- Integrated w/ Lifecycle Management

## S3 Data Protection
	- Optionally require Multi-factor Authentication:
		- Safeguard against accidental deletion of an object
		- Change the versioning state of your bucket

	- Cross region replication
		- Security
		- Compliance
		- Latency

## S3 Lifecycle Management
		- Optimize storage costs
		- Adhere to data retention policies
		- keep S3 volumes well-maintained

## S3 Analytics

Data Lake Concepts									Athena, Redshift Spectrum, QuickSight
IoT Streaming Data Repo							Kinesis Firehose
Machine Learning & AI storage				Rekognition, Lex, MXNet
Storage Class Analysis 							S3 Management Analytics


## S3 Encryption at Rest

	Encryption Optional								Meaning
 ---------------------							--------------------
 SS3-S3															Use S3's existing encryption key for AES-256
 SS3-C															Upload your own AES-256 encryption key which
 																		S3 will use when it writes the objects.
 SS3-KMS														Use a key generated and managed by AWS Key
 																		Management Service
 Client-Side 												Encrypt objects using your own local encryption
                                    process before uploading to S3 (PGP, GPG, etc.)


## S3 Tricks

Transfer Accelerations						Speed up data uploads using CloudFront in reverse

Requestor Pays 										The requestor rather than the bucket owner
																	pays for requests and data transfer.

Tags 															Assign tags to objects for use in costing,
                                  billing, security, etc.

Events 														Trigger notifications to SNS, SQS or Lambda
																	when certain events happen in your bucket

Static Web Hosting 								Simple and massively scalable static website hosting

BitTorrent 												Use the BitTorrent protocol to retrieve any
																	publicly available object by automatically
																	generating a .torrent file.


## Glacier
#############

	- Cheap, slow to respond, seldom accessed
	- "Cold Storage"
	- Used by AWS Storage Gateway Virtual Tape Library
	- Integrated with AWS s3 via Lifecycle Management
	- Faster retrieval speed options if you pay more



                               +---------+  - File, zip, tar, etc
          +-------------+      | Archive |  - Max size 40TB
          |             |      +---------+  - Immutable
          |             | <---------+
[IAM]     |   Glacier   |
  access  |   Vault     |       +--------+
  +-----> |             |       |        |  - Different than vault access policy
          +-------------+       | Glacier|  - Enforce rules like no deletes or MFA
                  ^             | Vault  |  - Immutable
                  |             | Lock   |
                  |             +--------+
                  +---------------+
                      Policy


  Glacier Vault like S3 bucket
  Glacier Archive like an S3 object
	Policy: rules for that Glacier Vault (no delete or use MFA)
	Access done via IAM


	Create a Glacier Vault Lock then Initiate a vault lock
				- 24 hours to confirm vault lock
				- After 24 hours and is not confirmed: vault lock aborted
				- Complete vault lock within 24 hours: applies vault lock permanently



## Elastic Block Storage
##########################

	- "virtual hard drives"
	- Can only be used with EC2
	- Tied to a single AZ
	- Variety of Optimized choices for IOPS, throughtput and cost
	- Snapshots!!

	Instance Store vs. EBS:
			- Instance Store is temporary, only available when EC2 is running
			- ideal for caches, buffers, work areas
			- data goes away when EC2 is stopped or terminated
			- locked to that EC2
			- EBS not locked to EC2
			- EBS can create snapshot
			- Instance store is "attached"
			- EBS over network

EBS Snapshots
	- cost-effective and easy backup
	- share data sets with other users or accounts
					- share the snapshot and user can create a volume from it
	- Migrate a system to a new AZ or Region
			REMEMBER: EBS tied to a single AZ, snapshots allow you to migrate
	- convert unencrypted volume to an encrypted volume
					- create EBS from volume and check encrypt check box



	First snapshot stores the entire block store
	Subsequent snapshots store just the delta (but also contain the base)
	If you delete 1st snapshot and

     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   | 1 | O |   |   |	 	== Snapshot 1
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   | 0 | 1 |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|

add two pieces of in and Snapshot 2 looks like this

     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 1 |   |   |   |   |	 	== Snapshot 2
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 0 |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|

restoring from snapshot 2 will give you

     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 1 | 1 | 0 |   |   |	 	== Restored Snapshot 2
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   | 0 | 1 |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 0 |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|

add 1 piece and delete 1 piece of data Snapshot 3 looks like this

     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |	 	== Snapshot 3
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   | 1 |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | X |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|

restoring from snapshot 3 will give you

     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     | 1 | 1 | 0 |   |   |	 	== Restored Snapshot 3
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   | 0 | 1 | 1 |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|
     |   |   |   |   |   |
     |---|---|---|---|---|

REMEMBER:
	- FIRST snapshot gets charged for the full EBS size
	- All other snapshots after 1st get charged for JUST THE DELTA of storage
	- If delete intermediate snapshots you can restore a later snapshot
	- If delete FIRST snapshot, can restore later snapshots

THINK Snapshots as collection of pointers to data.
		- Pointers pulled forward to next most recent snap


## Elastic File Service
##########################

	- implementation of NFS file share
	- elastic storage capacity, and pay for only what you use (unlike EBS)
	- EFS 3x expensive as EBS,  20x expensive as S3
	- Multi-AZ metadata and data storage
	- Configure mount-points in one or many AZs
			- EC2 can mount local to their AZ
	- Can be mounted from on-premises systems ONLY if using Direct Connect
	- Alternatively, use EFS File Sync agent
				- load on premise and syncronize to EFS

	- EFS supports MOST features of NFS V4 BUT NOT ALL
